## Install dependency


```bash
 pip3 install pyAesCrypt
```


## Save the script above as aes_bruteforce_mp.py and make executable:

```bash
 chmod +x aes_bruteforce_mp.py
```


## run

```bash
 python3 aes_bruteforce_mp.py --aes backup.aes --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --out recovered_archive.zip --workers 6 --checkpoint .aes_ckpt --chunk 400
```


* --workers tune to number of CPU cores (or fewer if disk/CPU thrashes).

* --chunk controls how many passwords are sent in a batch; smaller if you want more frequent checkpointing.

* If itâ€™s interrupted, re-run the same command and it will resume from the last checkpoint line.
